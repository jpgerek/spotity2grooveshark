To start rename the file config_sample.json to config.json.
When importing a playlist from spotify you need an account from grooveshark, a prompt
will ask for a valid username and password, you can optionally avoid it by filling the
file config.json with the a valid username and password from spotify.

Example:

./spotify_to_grooveshark_playlist.py <spotify_songs_file>

The file must have an spotify song link per line.

There are some other interesting commands I'll let you discover by your own ;)
